    <h2 class="text-center"> What is the story of Christmas?</h2>
    <p>

        Jesus was born to a woman called Mary who was engaged to Joseph, a carpenter in the town of Nazareth in Galilee.
        Mary was visited by an angel who told her that she would give birth to a baby called Jesus. Jesus was born in Bethlehem
        because Joseph and Mary had travelled there to take part in a census which the Roman rulers had ordered.When Mary and Joseph
        arrived in Bethlehem the local inn was full with people returning for the census. The innkeeper let them stay in the rock cave
        below his house which was used as a stable for animals. It was here that Mary gave birth to Jesus.

        <p>
            The story of Jesus's birth (also known as the nativity) is often retold by children taking part in nativity plays.Christian church services
            at Christmas include carol singing. These are happy songs which tell the Christmas story. Some Christians start Christmas Day with a midnight
            communion service (also called a midnight mass).Christmas dinners are also an important part of the celebrations. Families and friends will
            share food together, eating traditional foods, such as turkey, mince pies and Christmas pudding.
